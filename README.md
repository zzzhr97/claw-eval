## Leaderboard

Browse the full leaderboard and individual task cases at **[claw-eval.github.io](https://claw-eval.github.io)**.

**Evaluation Logic (Updated March 2026):**

* **Primary Metric: Pass^3.** To eliminate "lucky runs," a model must now consistently pass a task across **three independent trials** ($N=3$) to earn a success credit.
* **Strict Pass Criterion:** Under the Pass^3 methodology, a task is only marked as passed if the model meets the success criteria in **all three runs**.
* **Reproducibility:** We are committed to end-to-end reproducibility. Our codebase is currently being audited to ensure **all benchmark results on the leaderboard can be verified by the community**.
* **Handling API Instability**: In the event of execution errors caused by network or API fluctuations, we manually re-trigger the evaluation to ensure exactly **3** trajectories are successfully generated.


## 📢 Updates
* **v1.1.0 is now live! 35 more challenging multimodal agentic tasks — agents perceive, reason, create, and deliver.**

* v1.0.0 is now live!
Built on reproducible real-world complexity.

* v0.0.0 released: from chatbot to real world. (2026.3)



## Quick Start

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for fast, reliable dependency management:

```bash
pip install uv
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Prepare your keys and set up the environments with one command:

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
export SERP_DEV_KEY=... # add this for tasks need real web search
bash scripts/test_sandbox.sh
```

> **Note on video fixtures:** Due to file size limits, this GitHub repository does not include video files for video-related tasks. The complete fixtures (including all videos) are available on Hugging Face: [claw-eval/Claw-Eval](https://huggingface.co/datasets/claw-eval/Claw-Eval).

Go rock 🚀

```bash
# config.yaml 已配置 openrouter base_url + anthropic/claude-opus-4.6 待测模型
claw-eval batch --config config.yaml --sandbox --trials 3 --parallel 16
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] More real-world, multimodal tasks in complex productivity environments
- [ ] Comprehensive, fine-grained scoring logic with deep state verification
- [ ] Enhanced sandbox isolation and full-trace tracking for transparent, scalable evaluation


## Contribution
We welcome any kind of contribution. Let us know if you have any suggestions!

## Acknowledgements
Our test cases are built on the work of the community. We draw from and adapt tasks contributed by OpenClaw, PinBench, OfficeQA, OneMillion-Bench, Finance Agent, and Terminal-Bench 2.0.
